Git Cheat Sheet 
 - git show <SHA hash code> : shows the modifications applied at the specified commit.
 - git log: gives information about the commit history up to the commit you currently have checked out (i.e. the commit pointed to by HEAD)
 - git checkout: this can be used to discard changes made in the working tree by checking out (overwriting files with) previous versions 
 - git init: creates a hidden folder called .git that it uses to store the history of the your repoisitory 
 - git reset: The git reset command changes where HEAD and the current branch name (e.g. master) refer to. By resetting it to refer to an 
              older commit, you effectively forget about the newer commit. Note that it does not get deleted from disk, it just disappeared 
              from gitâ€™s history books
